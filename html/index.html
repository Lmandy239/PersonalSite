            <p>
                I’ve done a few projects myself in the past, from basic Java logic problems to some full stack
                applications. However, the ones I’m the proudest of are:
                <br>
                <br>

                A group Recipe Recommender Application, which allows users to log in and select from a database of
                over 7,000 ingredients to then add them to a cart. Once the cart is filled up, the users have the option
                to search for recipes that best match the cart. The app selects from a database of over 12,000 recipes
                and displays the top 6.
                <br>
                <br>

                <strong>The link to the deployed website:</strong>
                <br>
                <br>

                <a href="http://3.22.134.152:8080/BootRecipeRecommender/"><button class="btn btn-primary">Recipe
                        App</button></a>
                <br>
                <br>
                All one needs to do is create a stub account to log in then everything is accessible. The most
                interesting part about this project beyond its purpose is the ability for the user's cart to persist
                through sessions and accounts. I was in charge of personally doing this part of the project.
            </p>

                <p>
                    This took some relational database mapping and proper entity mapping on the back-end spring boot
                    side.

                    I mapped the relationship between users and user ingredients to a joint table so that the users
                    cart choices would persist, the user is both able to add and delete ingredients as shown above
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="images/database.jpeg" alt="Image 2" class="img-fluid mb-2">
                <br>
                <p>(table relationship) </p>
                <br>
                <img src="images/usermap.jpeg" alt="Image 3" class="img-fluid mb-2">
                <br>
                <p>
                    (Entity Mapping on the User Class)

                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="images/manymany.jpeg" alt="Image 3" class="img-fluid mb-2">
                <br>
                <p>
                    (Ingredient side)
                    <br>
                    The controller logic I used for the cart (applying MVC with DAO’s):
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="images/cartcontroller.jpeg" alt="Image 3" class="img-fluid mb-2">
                <br>
                <p>
                    Lastly the user Dao Implementation methods for this are being overwritten from a user DAO
                    interface. It is also worth noting that I used a JPQL query to communicate with the database to
                    delete from the cart:
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="images/cartmethod.jpeg" alt="Image 3" class="img-fluid mb-2">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                Another Project I recently did was an event tracker. The theme of the tracker is books; however, not
                everything in the database must be a “book” which is why I'm not too proud of it. However, I used
                RESTful services for the back end and Angular JS to do this one. The app also allows the users full
                CRUD of books they add or current ones. As well as the option to search by title.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Link to event Tracker:</strong>
                <br>
                <br>

                <a href="http://3.22.134.152:8080/RESTBookTracker/"><button class="btn btn-primary">Event
                        Tracker</button></a>
            </p>
            <br>

            <div class="card p-4 mt-2">
                <img src="images/endpoints.jpeg" alt="endpoints" class="img-fluid mb-2">
                <br>
                <p>
                    Instead of sharing the code snippets for the repository methods, which are all automatic as most
                    of them were findById or DeleteById. I figured it’d be good to show the end points of the backend
                    logic, I also set the status codes and tested it with Postman:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The only end point not mapped here was a controller I later added for a search by title
                    functionality
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="images/searchbyname.jpeg" alt="name search" class="img-fluid mb-2">
                <br>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                Lastly, I have over 15 repositories with some projects I’ve done throughout my boot camp and some
                other personal/ college ones.

                One significant hurdle was the need to test the back end of my projects, which prompted me to delve
                into concepts like JSON, request bodies, headers, and understanding status codes. This exploration was
                crucial to enhance the functionality of my applications. Authentication became another area of focus,
                although this was more of a front-end testing on new angular servers rather than back-end logic. To
                test all this stuff, I took the initiative to learn about Postman and its features. This tool proved
                to be useful for testing the functionality of my applications and the security measures. Additionally,
                the transition from utilizing JPQL and JPA to embracing RESTful services presented a noteworthy
                challenge. Previously relying on DAOs and crafting my own logic for methods, I had to adapt to using
                the JPArepository implementation and properly creating methods within the specific repositories.
                Moreover, although not directly related to back end. For my apps to look nice and clean, I had to learn
                frameworks such as Angular and Bootstrap. Which I think highlights my ability to learn new stuff that
                can make my products much better and viable.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another particularly rewarding experience involved working on the Recipe Recommender project.
                Initially, we used arrays to create a user's cart to store ingredients. However, this would not persist
                the choices. Meaning I had to figure a way to make it happen. Therefore, I undertook a thorough
                investigation to implement proper many-to-many relationships. Which is how I was able to connect the
                tables on MySQL Workbench and then map the proper entity relationships.
                <br>
                <br>
                These challenges, ranging from mastering new technologies like JSON and Postman to adapting to RESTful
                APIs and tackling complex database relationships or learning Angular and Bootstrap reflect my
                enthusiasm for pushing the boundaries of my knowledge. They underscore my commitment to staying abreast
                of the latest developments in the field and my eagerness to apply this knowledge to create innovative
                and efficient solutions – qualities that I personally believe align with the requirements of the role.
